# Budget-Tracker
A Python-based home budget app that solves the hassle of manual tracking. It automates calculations and uses a unique design to minimize user input. The app analyzes spending, groups similar items for accuracy, and provides visual comparisons, turning a complex chore into a simple and fast task.

#Features:

Automated Calculation: "The app automates all calculations, so you never have to manually tally up expenses."

Minimal User Input: "Designed to be as fast as possible. Simply input your expenses and let the app handle the rest."

Intelligent Grouping: "The app intelligently groups similar items (e.g. typos) to provide a more accurate analysis of your spending habits."

Visual Analysis: "Provides clear, visual comparisons (e.g., charts) of your spending over the year."

Unique Design: The app uses a design that simulates pen and paper, to mimic how people usually calculate their spendings in notebooks.

In the link above you can see it is very straightfoward, to install you only need to open the .apk and the phone will ask you permission to install, it was only tested in Android Systems

#Project Status:

Finished

#Built with Python 3.11

Libraries
The project uses the following Python modules to build and run the app:

Kivy: This is the main framework used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) for the app. It handles the layout, user interactions, and makes the app compatible with Android.

Python Standard Library: The app uses several built-in Python modules for its core logic and data handling, including:

datetime: For managing and tracking expenses by date.

json: For saving and loading your budget data to a file.

os: For interacting with the file system to store and access app data.

re: For text matching and processing, which helps with the "Intelligent Grouping" feature.
