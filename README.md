### Project Status

**Finished**

---

### Built with Python 3.11

### Libraries

The project uses the following Python modules to build and run the app:

* **Kivy:** This is the main framework used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) for the app. It handles the layout, user interactions, and makes the app compatible with Android.
* **Python Standard Library:** The app uses several built-in Python modules for its core logic and data handling, including:
    * `datetime`: For managing and tracking expenses by date.
    * `json`: For saving and loading your budget data to a file.
    * `os`: For interacting with the file system to store and access app data.
    * `re`: For text matching and processing, which helps with the "Intelligent Grouping" feature.
